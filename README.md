# Activerecord Model Rails Lab

## Objectives

1. Create a migration by hand
2. Create a model by hand
3. Build a model instance method


## Notes

Given a rails app lets test a student's ability to add a model to it. 
Simple lab- see if students can add a migration file and a model file, and have really small tests

tests for Post with a post title and a post.author_name and then post.to_s to generate "#{post.title}, by #{post.author_name}"
